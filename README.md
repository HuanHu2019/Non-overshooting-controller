# Iterative reward shaping for non-overshooting altitude control of a wing-in-ground craft based on deep reinforcement learning
* The codes are presented in seperate dierectory according to the section of 'Cases and analysis' in the manuscript. 
* As for each sub case, eight different seeds are used and the one rewarded mostly is picked as the result. So, there are 8 dierectories at each sub-sub directory.
* Since the website of Github limits the size of files, main results are placed in the same directory and they are upload in onedrive. The link is https://maildluteducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/huhuan2019_mail_dlut_edu_cn/EnfjpZlH5URIteBXVf55bIUBFbkowtktd30EE767rn5naA?e=R5faeH
* In order to run the code at each sub-sub directory, the file 'datacollection.npy' should be downloaded and then placed in the root directory, meaning that it is placed with 'Case1_Scheme_1_twoitems', etc.
